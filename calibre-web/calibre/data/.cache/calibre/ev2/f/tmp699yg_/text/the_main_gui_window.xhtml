There are a few components I would like to bring to your attention. The central piece is the book list. This takes up the majority of the window and displays the books in a table. Just above the book list you will see the search area (more on this later) and above that, the tool bar. When you connect a supported e-book reader a ‘Device’ icon will appear next to the ’Library’ icon in the tool bar. You can switch between viewing books in your library and books on your e-book reader by clicking on their respective icons.","l":"\n\n  "},{"n":"p","x":"The panel along the right of the window shows details about the currently selected book, including its cover. If you double click anywhere in the detail area (including on the book cover) another window will open exposing more information about the book. Clicking on any blue text in this area will perform an action specific to the information. For example, clicking the author’s name will open your web browser and search Wikipedia for information about the author.","l":"\n\n  "},{"n":"p","x":"At the bottom right of the window there are four icons and the word “Jobs”.

The book list will still be visible under the cover flow area.","l":"\n\n    "},{"n":"li","x":"The nine squares in a grid toggles cover grid view.

Whenever calibre is working on something (conversion, sending books to the reader, downloading news, etc.) the circular icon will spin and the number will reflect the number of jobs (activities) calibre is working on. You can click any part of the jobs indicator to show more detail about the jobs in progress.","l":"\n  "}]}]}]},"ns_map":["http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"]}
